Routing is used to navigate from one component to another component in angular
Three steps to Routing:-

    Add routing links in template
Configuring the routes:-
    eg :- [
        {
            path:'',component:Home component
        },
        {
            path:'users',component:Users component
        },       
        {
            path:'about',component:About component
        }
    ]

    Route Parameters:-
    [
        {
            path:'users/:id',component:UserComponent
